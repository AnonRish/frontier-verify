# Frontier Verify

**Status: Phase 4 -- experimental, pre-alpha.** Real, tested, running
code for tamper-evident record-keeping of self-reported AI compute
evidence, now with a tested multi-verifier quorum experiment, a real
(if tiny) numerical recomputation kernel, empirically-verified
reproducible builds, and audit-logged administrative actions. **Still
NOT independently reviewed by anyone who didn't write it, still NOT
tested against real hardware of any kind** -- see
[`docs/reviews/external-review.md`](docs/reviews/external-review.md) and
[`docs/hardware/nvidia-validation-report.md`](docs/hardware/nvidia-validation-report.md),
both honestly unexecuted. Read
[`docs/threat-model.md`](docs/threat-model.md) and
[`docs/adversarial-results.md`](docs/adversarial-results.md) before
trusting this for anything beyond local development.

## What this is

An open-source reference implementation working toward independent
verification of frontier AI computation and inference, in the spirit of
the AI-2040 verification agenda, architecturally aligned with IETF RATS
(RFC 9334) -- see [`docs/ecosystem-interoperability.md`](docs/ecosystem-interoperability.md).

See [`docs/ai2040-coverage-matrix.md`](docs/ai2040-coverage-matrix.md) for
a workstream-by-workstream honest status against the full AI-2040 agenda
-- most of it is still `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`, and that table says so plainly.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone <this-repo> && cd frontier-verify
python3 -m pip install -e ".[dev]"

# run the full test suite (123 tests + 4 hardware tests that skip
# cleanly without a GPU: unit, security, adversarial, integration,
# conformance)
pytest

# run the local demo (mock attestation -> evidence -> verify -> signed
# receipt -> independent offline verification -> tamper check -> key
# rotation -> old receipt still verifiable)
python3 examples/local-demo/run_demo.py

# verify a receipt with NO dependency on this package at all
python3 tools/standalone-verifier/verify_receipt.py receipt.json <public_key_hex>
node tools/standalone-verifier/verify_receipt.js receipt.json <public_key_hex>  # genuine second-language implementation

# or drive the real server + CLI end to end
export FV_API_KEYS=dev-key:PROVER|POLICY_AUTHORITY|ADMINISTRATOR|AUDITOR
fv init
fv doctor
fv attest --out attestation.json
fv evidence build --model-digest sha256:... --attestation-file attestation.json --out evidence.json
uvicorn frontier_verify.api.main:app --reload &
# ... POST evidence.json + a policy to /v1/evidence and /v1/policies/validate
# (with header X-Api-Key: dev-key), POST to /v1/inferences/verify, then:
fv receipt verify receipt.json --public-key-hex <from GET /v1/verifier/public-key>
```

There is no `docker compose` demo. It was deliberately not built: this
repo's own development environment has no Docker, and a compose file no
one has run is worse than no compose file.

## Tools

- [`tools/standalone-verifier/`](tools/standalone-verifier/) -- a single
  file that verifies a receipt with no dependency on this package,
  cross-checked against the reference implementation on every test run.
- [`examples/integration/generic_python_service/`](examples/integration/generic_python_service/) --
  a real, tested async evidence-submission wrapper for any Python
  inference function.
